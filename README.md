Welcome to the home page of the AiArtNFT dapp.

## Start Here:

- [**AiArtNFT Dapp**](https://www.aiartnft.app/) is running live on the cloud.
- [**Slide Deck**](https://heyzine.com/flip-book/f365cb1514.html describes the project and the dapp.
- [**YouTube Video**](https://youtu.be/guELHaItI8Q) is the demo video for the hackathon.


## Executive Summary
  
**[AiArtNFT.app](https://AiArtNFT.app)** is an **NFT marketplace with built-in Generative AI system,** that **generates art from text**, using **OpenAI's DALL-E API**, and enables the selection of the generated image and immediate placement of that image into an NFT marketplace. 

**Novelty** is that, while  it is possible to find many text-to-image generation web services  and many NFT marketplaces, to the best of our knowledge, there are only two Web 3 dApps, as hackathon projects that **integrate AI art generation with NFT marketplace.**

The app was designed, developed, and implemented during the period of [XRPL Hackathon: NFT Launch Party](https://xrplnft.devpost.com/) by the project team.
