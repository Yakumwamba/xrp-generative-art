## Executive Summary
  
**[AiArtNFT.app](https://AiArtNFT.app)** is 
- an **NFT marketplace with built-in Generative AI system,** that 
- **generates art from text**, using **OpenAI's DALL-E API**, and 
- enables the selection of the generated image and immediate placement of that image into an NFT marketplace. 

The app was designed, developed, and implemented during the period of [XRPL Hackathon: NFT Launch Party](https://xrplnft.devpost.com/) by the project team.
